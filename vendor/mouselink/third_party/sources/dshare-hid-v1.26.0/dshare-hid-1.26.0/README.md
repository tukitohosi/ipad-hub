## Introduction

DShare-HID is a high-performance, open-source project derived from [Deskflow](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow). While sharing the core architecture, DShare-HID is an independent fork focused on sharing keyboard and mouse inputs with mobile devices including iPad, iPhone, and Android phones.


## Expanding the Deskflow Ecosystem: Mobile Integration

While traditional software KVM solutions like Deskflow work great between computers, they cannot support mobile platforms like iPadOS or Android. DShare-HID bridges this gap by extending Deskflow's capabilities to these devices:
- **iOS and Android** do not allow background apps to intercept or simulate system-wide HID (Human Interface Device) events for security reasons.
- **Apple Sidecar/Universal Control** is restricted to the Apple ecosystem, leaving Windows and Linux users behind.
- **Remote Desktop** solutions often suffer from high latency and depend on network stability, which can impact fluid, real-time peripheral sharing.

## The Solution: Hardware Bridge Client

DShare-HID uses a budget-friendly (~$2.50 USD on AliExpress) **ESP32-C3 Supermini** board as a hardware bridge. It converts Deskflow events into **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) HID**, letting you wirelessly share your keyboard and mouse with any mobile device.

## Key Features

- **Native Experience**: No apps or drivers are required on the target device. It sees a standard Bluetooth peripheral.
- **Ultra-Low Latency**: Offers superior responsiveness compared to remote screen sharing solutions.
- **Universal Compatibility**: Fully supports **Windows, macOS, and Linux** hosts. Compatible with official upstream Deskflow clients.
- **Multi-Device Pairing**: Securely pair and toggle between up to **6 mobile devices**. Switching is instantaneous and effortless.
- **US Layout & International Flexibility**: Acts as a standard US layout keyboard but supports native iOS/Android "Hardware Keyboard" settings for non-US mappings.
- **Consumer Key Support**: Dedicated control for media keys, including Play/Pause and Volume.
- **Native External Display**: Use your tablet as a high-quality secondary screen.


> [!NOTE]
> **Clipboard Sharing**: Deskflow's network clipboard sharing is not supported at the moment but will be supported in a future update.

#### Option B: Manual Install
1.  Download the latest `.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/lockekk/dshare-hid/releases) page.
2.  Open `dshare-hid-1.26.0-macos-universal.dmg` and drag the application to your `Applications` folder.
3.  **Note**: If you encounter a "Damaged" or "Unverified" error, run the following command in Terminal:
    ```bash
    xattr -cr /Applications/DShare-HID.app
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Permissions & Setup**:
> - **Accessibility Access**: You must grant "Accessibility" access (Privacy & Security) to both the **DShare-HID** app and the **dshare-hid** process.
> - **macOS Sequoia**: You may also need to allow DShare-HID under "Local Network" settings.
> - **Upgrading**: If you are upgrading and already have DShare-HID on the allowed list, you may need to **manually remove** the old entries before accessibility access can be granted to the new version.

### Windows
**Dependency**: Please ensure you have installed **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable v14.44 or later** before use.

Available as a portable archive (Recommended) or installer.

-   **Portable (.7z)**: **Recommended**. Extract and run `dshare-hid.exe`.
-   **Installer (.msi)**: Download and double-click to install.

### Linux
We support major distributions via AppImage and Flatpak.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Permissions**: To access the USB device, your user **must** have permission to access serial ports (usually the `dialout` group).
> Run the following command and then **logout and login** (or **reboot**) for the change to take effect:
> ```bash
> sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
> ```

#### Option A: AppImage (Universal)

</div>

### 1. Prepare Hardware
You will need an **ESP32-C3 Supermini** board. These are cheap and widely available from AliExpress or local electronics stores. Connect it to your computer via USB.

### 2. Access Flash Tool
Open DShare-HID and navigate to **File -> Firmware** to open the management interface.

### 3. Setup (For New Devices)

1.  **Factory Mode (Online)**:
    *   Go to the **Factory Mode** tab.
    *   Click **Flash** under the "Online" section to install the generic factory firmware.
    *   This prepares the device for pairing and licensing.

2.  **Request per-device application**:
    *   Go to the **Order** tab.
    *   Choose **Request 7-Day Free Trial** or **Purchase Full License**.
    *   Fill in your details and click **Email** to send the request.
    *   You will receive a specific **per-device firmware file** (e.g., `app_xxxx.uzip`) via email.

3.  **Install Application (Manual)**:
    *   Go to the **Upgrade Mode** tab.
    *   Under "Manual", browse and select the file you received.
    *   Click **Flash** to install your licensed firmware.

### 4. Updates & Maintenance
*   **Upgrading**: Go to the **Upgrade Mode** tab and click **Check for Updates** -> **Flash** to install the latest features via OTA.
*   **Activation**: Go to the **Activation** tab to view your license status or input a new activation key.
